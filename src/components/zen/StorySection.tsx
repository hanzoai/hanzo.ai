            Hanzo began as Crowdstart, a small, hungry team driving explosive product launches—most notably, 
            the record-breaking SKULLY Technologies AR-1 helmet on Indiegogo, raising millions and demonstrating 
            the immense power of data-driven innovation. That success signaled we were onto something special.

          <p className="text-neutral-300 md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            We soon evolved into Hanzo AI, incubated by Techstars, pioneering intelligent e-commerce, 
            AI-driven marketing, and blockchain innovation. Our tools democratized technology previously 
            reserved for giants, enabling startups and enterprises alike to scale beyond expectation. 
            Under the leadership of co-founders Zach Kelling (Founding CTO) and Michael Kelling 
            (original co-founder, current CEO), Hanzo became synonymous with turning ambitious ideas into reality.

          <p className="text-neutral-300 md:text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Today, as Hanzo Industries, we fuse AI and engineering discipline to build powerful platforms, 
            open-source tools, and autonomous AI solutions—fueling the next generation of innovation.
