# Maintenance Report

## Recent Changes (2025-04-07)

### 1. Fixed ProductsMenu Export/Import Issue
- **Issue**: The ProductsMenu component was exported with a named export but imported as a default export in DesktopNav.tsx, causing a module resolution error: "The requested module doesn't provide an export named: 'ProductsMenu'"
- **Solution**: Added default export to ProductsMenu and updated the import in DesktopNav.tsx to use a default import.
- **Commit**: [fdf6f92](https://github.com/hanzoai/hanzo.ai/commit/fdf6f92) - "Fix ProductsMenu export and update Node.js compatibility"

### 2. Updated Node.js Version Requirements
- **Issue**: The project required modern JavaScript features (nullish coalescing assignment operator) not supported in Node.js v14.
- **Solution**: Added .nvmrc file specifying Node.js v20 and updated package.json script to suppress warnings.
- **Commit**: [fdf6f92](https://github.com/hanzoai/hanzo.ai/commit/fdf6f92) - "Fix ProductsMenu export and update Node.js compatibility"



## Issues Identified

### 4. Node.js Version Compatibility
- **Status**: RESOLVED
- **Issue**: The project required Node.js with support for modern JavaScript features.
- **Solution**: Added .nvmrc specifying Node.js v20 and configured package.json to suppress warnings.
- **Command to use**: 
  ```bash
  nvm use
  npm run dev
  ```

### 3. Security Vulnerabilities
- GitHub reports 2 moderate security vulnerabilities in the dependencies.
- **Recommendation**: Review and address these vulnerabilities using:
  ```bash
  npm audit fix
  # or for a more aggressive approach that might update to new major versions
  npm audit fix --force
  ```

## Project Structure Analysis
- The project is a React application using Vite as the build tool.
- Routing is handled by react-router-dom with separate routes for marketing pages and account pages.
- UI components are organized by feature/page in the components directory.
- The navigation system uses dropdown menus for Products, Solutions, and Resources sections.

## Next Steps
1. Upgrade Node.js to a compatible version (v18+).
2. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed.
3. Address security vulnerabilities with `npm audit fix`.
4. Continue with feature development or bug fixes as needed.
